# SNHU_IT_230
This is my term project in C#. This allows a user to register for courses, while checking that the user doesn't register for the same class more than once or more than 9 credit hours. 

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?
This program takes in the user input of a course selection and registers the student for the course. This application was designed to check that the student doesn't register for the same course more than once and that they didn't register for more than 9 credit hours. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this application?
In developing this application, I was able to adapt and modify the code as necessary or as new "concerns" arose.

Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
These designs were successful because they were simple and not too flashy to be too distracting so that way the user can register as quickly and painlessly as possible. 

How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?
To debug, I used a mixture of hands-on testing and the Visual Studio debugger. These techniques and strategies will be useful because they can help me find errors that a human could come across while using the program. The debugger in Studio helps by stepping through the code and attempting to isolate where the code begins to error. 

Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?
I had to be innovative in ensuring that the program successfully registers students if their total credit hours are less than 9.
